  Rich Waters of <a href="http://extjs.com" target="_new">Ext JS</a> has put up a  <a href="http://extjs.com/blog/2008/06/10/extjs-and-jaxer/" target="_new">great example</a> of using Ext JS server-side with Aptana Jaxer.  Check out the example and from there get the full source code to give it a go yourself.

  <p>
  &quot;We can see that Jaxer lets developers leverage the hard work which has already been spent building client-side libraries on the server-side. These simple examples show off some of the true potential of utilizing the Ext JS framework on the server-side&quot; says Rich.

  <p>
  The easy to follow example shows off a very simple wrapper around an Ext.data.Store and the corresponding Jaxer server code that returns JSON to a Ext JS datagrid.
